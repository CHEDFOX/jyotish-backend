"""
VEDHA (OBSTRUCTION) FOR GOCHARA
Classical rule: a favorable transit can be NULLIFIED if another
planet occupies its vedha point.

Example: Jupiter transiting the 2nd house (favorable) is obstructed
if any planet transits the 12th house (vedha point for 2nd).

Without vedha checking, transit predictions overstate positive results.
