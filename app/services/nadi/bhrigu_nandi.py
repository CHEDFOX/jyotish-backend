JYOTISH ENGINE - BHRIGU NANDI NADI
Planet-in-sign = specific life predictions.
Based on Bhrigu Nandi Nadi texts.

Principle: Each planet in each sign gives SPECIFIC life events,
not generic descriptions. "Jupiter in Aries in 5th = first child is son,
career in teaching/law." This is what makes Nadi feel supernatural.

Also includes:
- Planet-in-house Nadi readings
- Two-planet conjunction Nadi combinations
- Nakshatra-pada specific predictions
