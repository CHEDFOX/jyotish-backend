JYOTISH ENGINE - ARGALA (JAIMINI PLANETARY INTERVENTION)
How planets INTERVENE on houses.

Primary Argala: Planets in 2nd, 4th, 11th from a house
Secondary Argala: Planet in 5th from a house
Obstruction (Virodha): Planets in 3rd, 10th, 12th block the argala

If argala has MORE planets than its obstruction → argala prevails.
This shows which houses receive SUPPORT and which are BLOCKED.
